# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview of Project
This project is to assist PyBer company to improve access to ride-sharing services by analyzing 2 data sets about ride fare and drivers count in 3 types of city: urban, suburban and rural. From the data resources, the analyst calculates the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculates the average fare per ride and average fare per driver and weekly fares for each city type.
 
## 2. Result

### 2.1 Average fare per ride:
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride$34.62 while urban cities have the lowest fare per ride $24.53.
- Average fare per ride of suburban city is $30.97.
- This is because the number of rides in rural cities is 10 times lower than the number of rides in urban cities (125 vs 1,625 rides).

### 2.2 Average fare per driver:
- Similarly, rural cities have the highest fare per driver $55.49 while urban cities have the lowest of $16.57.
- Average fare per driver in suburban city is $39.5
- This is because urban cities have way fewer drivers than urban cities (78 vs. 2,405)

### 2.3 Total weekly fare for each type of city from Jan 1, 2019 to Apr 29, 2019.

![Title](Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

- Total weekly fare of urban cities is the highest among 3 types of city. Rural cities' is the lowest. 
- In all 3 types of city, the fare is highest in the last week of February, following by a decline of fare in the first week of Mar.
- Fare of urban cities is volatile during the period from the last week of Feb to the first week of Apr.
- Fare of suburban cities stays constant most of the time except for a spike in the last week of Feb and 2 downfalls in the first week of Mar and the 2nd week of Apr.
- Fare of rural cities goes up and down frequently but the change is not as large as in urban and suburban cities.

## 3. Summary

### 3.1 Average fare per ride and per driver:
- The average fare per ride and per driver in rural cities are much higher than those in urban and suburban cities because the driver count and ride count in rural cities are much lower. So we can hire more drivers in rural cities to drive down the fare. 

### 3.2 Spike of fare in the last week of Feb:
- In all 3 city types, the fare peaks to the highest in the last week of Feb. This maybe due to a decrease in the number of drivers during that time that lead to fewer rides. We can increase drivers' incentives or run promotion for customers to keep the fare low in the last week of Feb. 

### 3.3 Total weekly fare:
- Despite the lowest average fare per ride and per driver,  total weekly fare in urban cities is higher than that of suburban and rural cities. This is because the demand of ride is higher than the supply in urban cities in comparison with rural and suburban areas. We can increase the fare and pass the incentive to drivers. That way the number of rides.
